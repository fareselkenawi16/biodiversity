# biodiversity
In this project the perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservation status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:

What is the distribution of conservation status for species?

Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?

Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?

Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?

# Data
This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first csv file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project.
